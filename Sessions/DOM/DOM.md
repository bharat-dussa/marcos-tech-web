    Everything in HTML, even comments, becomes a part of the DOM. 
    
    Even the <!DOCTYPE...> directive at the very beginning of HTML is also a DOM node. It’s in the DOM tree right before <html>. Few people know about that. We are not going to touch that node, we even don’t draw it on diagrams, but it’s there.

    There are 12 node types. In practice we usually work with 4 of them:

    1. document – the “entry point” into DOM.
    2. element nodes – HTML-tags, the tree building blocks.
    3.text nodes – contain text.
    4.comments – sometimes we can put information there, it won’t be shown, but JS can read it from the DOM.

    
    
    Tags become element nodes and form the structure.

    Text becomes text nodes.
    everything in HTML has its place in DOM, even comments.
    
    
    
    
    The DOM allows us to do anything with elements and their contents, but first we need to reach the corresponding DOM object.
