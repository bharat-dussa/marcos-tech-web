// Data Types

// 1. Number
// - The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
let n = 123;
n = 12.345;


/**
 * let billion = 1000000000;
 * We also can use underscore _ as the separator:
 * let billion = 1_000_000_000;
 * 
 * 
 */

/**
 *  2. BigInt
 * In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot safely represent integer values larger than (253-1) 
 * (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(253-1) for negatives.
 * 
 */


/**
 *  3. String
 * A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
 * (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(253-1) for negatives.
 * 
 * ex: 
 * let str = "Hello";
 * let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
 * let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;
 */



/**
 *  4. Boolean (logical type)
 * The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
 * This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.
 * 
 * ex: 
 * let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
 * let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked
 */


/**
 *  5. The “null” value
 * The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.
 * It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:
 * It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

 * ex: 
 * let age = null;
 * 
 */


/**
 *  6. The undefined value
 * The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.
 * The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
 * It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

 * ex: 
 * let age;
 * alert(age); // shows "undefined"
 * 
 */


/**
 *  7. Objects and Symbols
 * The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.
 * The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
 * It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

 * ex: 
 * let age;
 * alert(age); // shows "undefined"
