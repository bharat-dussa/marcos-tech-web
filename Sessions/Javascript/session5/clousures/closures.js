/**
 * Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript. 
 * They occur when a function is defined inside another function and has access to the outer (enclosing) 
 * function's variables. Closures "remember" the scope in which they were created, 
 * even after the outer function has finished executing. 
 * They are essential for creating private variables, data encapsulation, and callback functions.
